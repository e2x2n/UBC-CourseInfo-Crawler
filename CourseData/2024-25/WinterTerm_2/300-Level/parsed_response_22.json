It aims to entice students to develop their own advanced style and voice in German by creative writing, and stylistic study of a variety of materials. In addition, we’ll combine this with a bit of grammatical exercises to broaden students’ comprehension and expression of German Contentwise, we are striving to further decolonize traditional concepts of teaching German and to put a fresh emphasis on interrelations of class, gender, and race.

That being said, the development of the genre in Germany is fascinatingly problematic, with politics interrupting continuity to such an extent that we'll have to search hard to find horror films made there between 1932 and the 1980s. In this course we will find, discuss and write about these isolated examples in addition to some Expressionist masterpieces and the best of a recent crop of horror films from the German-speaking countries.\n\nInterested in other courses within the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?

Topics may include architecture, decorative arts, and design; visual media; clothing; food; garbage and junk; museums, collecting practices, artifacts, and mementos; consumerism; crafting and DIY cultures. We will examine the relationship between production and consumption; consider how objects change their meanings as they move through time and space; and explore how the “stuff” of life has reflected (and sometimes challenged) distinctions of gender, race, class, and age. This course will allow students to develop skills in analyzing a range of historical artifacts, and to work more closely with sources of their choosing. In selecting final paper topics, students will be free to work on a region of their choice, not limited to the United States.",
