    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Course Description: Aristotle stands beside Plato as one of the dominant figures of ancient Greek philosophy and its legacy. His philosophical system offers new answers to problems of continuity through change; causation and the fundamental principles of the natural world; the nature of living beings; the soul, perceiving and thinking; and the goal of human life. In this course, we will approach Aristotle as a systematic thinker studying nature and human nature.\nThis is a reading-intensive lecture course: focus will be on reading and understanding primary texts from the corpus of Aristotle’s works, in English translation.  Attendance at lectures is expected.  There will be a fair amount of reading, some of it dense.  Students should read the assigned chapters before class and bring texts to class: quizzes and the literature final exam will test your knowledge of the course readings.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Overview\nContrary to popular belief, \"profit maximization\" is not the sole determinant in business. Business activities involve various parties whose interests are at stake, including employees, business collaborators, competitors, suppliers, local communities, and more. In this context, ethics should undoubtedly play a significant role. Additionally, assuming that individuals, whether in business or other aspects of life, are solely driven by financial gain is both inaccurate and dismissive. The majority of people value and are motivated by ethical principles.\n\nIn today’s world, businesses cannot and should not overlook the concerns of relevant stakeholders; rather, they should carefully consider these concerns when making business decisions. This course encourages you to adopt a broader perspective on business. Its objective is to cultivate your ability to recognize and consider the interests of all relevant stakeholders, find creative solutions to business challenges while considering these interests, and make business decisions that are guided by ethical considerations.\n\nWe will start with a discussion of several ethical theories and two theories concerning the nature of firms. Being familiar with these theories will enable us to identify ethically relevant factors and make ethical evaluations/decisions when addressing business problems. Then, we will apply these theories to various topics such as deception in business, women in business, and employee treatment.\n\nThroughout the term, we will extensively analyze case studies and apply the acquired theories to analyse these cases. Most importantly, we will practice using these theories to incorporate the concerns of all relevant stakeholders when analyzing and making ethically informed decisions to resolve the challenges presented by these cases.\n\nLearning Objectives\nAt the end of the course, successful students will be able to:\n(1) explain the relevance of ethics to business in terms of the topics covered in this course;\n(2) apply ethical theories to identify ethically relevant factors;\n(3) make business decisions that are both creative and ethically informed, while considering the interests of all relevant stakeholders.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Overview\nHealth policy has a profound impact on different aspects of our lives, such as our well-being, finances, life goals, and how we relate to ourselves and others. What makes health policies desirable? And how should we decide which health policy to adopt? This course approaches these questions from both ethical and practical perspectives. It aims to develop your ability to make ethically and practically informed judgements on healthcare issues based on relevant and reliable information, realistic understanding of the situation, and sound reasoning.\nThis course delves into in-depth discussions of drug legalization and abortion. Throughout the term, there will be plenty of case study discussions, enabling you to apply your knowledge and thinking skills to analyze practical problems.\nSome of the topics discussed in this course may be emotionally challenging (e.g. addiction and mental illness). Remember to be gentle with yourself and others. Do not hesitate to seek support if you need it. There are plenty of resources available (e.g. https://students.ubc.ca/health).\nLearning Objectives\nAt the end of the course, successful students will be able to:\n(1) explain, compare, and apply various ethical theories to analyze and evaluate health care issues;\n(2) present arguments, raise objections, and reply to objections in a clear and logical manner;\n(3) make ethical judgements based on relevant and reliable information, realistic understanding of the situation, and sound reasoning;\n(4) explain the relevance of ethics to healthcare policy in terms of the topics covered in this course.",
