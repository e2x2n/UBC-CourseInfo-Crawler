    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Do you hate war, want peace and are willing to do the thinking that precedes the abolition of war? Then this course is for you. It maps out the present-day terrain in the life of Slavic countries, where violent conflicts, transformed by technologies, blur the traditional borderlines between war and peace. The course teaches how to think about war by exploring its artistic representations in authentic prose, poetry, film, and song in English translation. The answers to be found can determine the major course of our lives and the lives of those who come after us.\n\nInterested in other courses within the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?
