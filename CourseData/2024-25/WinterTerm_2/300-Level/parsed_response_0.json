We will link questions about migration, new media networks, and digital selves to the ongoing projects of settler colonialism and empire. These inquiries will be illuminated through critical analyses of race, gender, and sexuality and by drawing from relevant fields of study, including critical race, new media, and Asian North American studies. In addition to reading scholarship from these fields, students will have the opportunity to engage films, TV, digital media, literature, music, and other cultural productions.",

Come examine these conflicting portraits of the modern Mediterranean, an area in which many Canadians have cultural roots. While some anthropologists have treated the Mediterranean as a single culture area, others have emphasized its diversity, seeing it as a border in which many different cultures have historically come into contact, and, at times, conflict.  Thus one of the course’s central questions will concern the nature and extent of the unity of the Mediterranean as constructed by both anthropologists and Mediterraneans themselves. Focusing on concepts such as honor and shame, hospitality, festivals and celebrations, gender, and conflict in the comparative study of Mediterranean cultures, we will explore the realities and representations of the peoples whose homes border on the Mediterranean Sea through a series of ethnographies, articles, films, and foods (yes, you read that right: get ready learn to cook and eat Med food!). \n\nProf. Magliocco is an Italian native who has conducted fieldwork in and published on the Mediterranean since 1986.",

While focusing on communication technologies (from newspapers, to photography, to social media), we broaden our scope to contemplate the expansive realm of media. We question the boundaries of what constitutes media and ask what else might be considered a medium. Through ethnographic examples, we learn how societies shape and are shaped by various media forms. Exploring media histories, theories, and methodologies, we scrutinize the essence of media, its workings, and anthropology's unique approach to its study.",
