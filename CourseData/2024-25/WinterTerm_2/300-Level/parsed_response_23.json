    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "In 24W, all sessions of this course will be held in person, including a group visit to the Museum of Anthropology at UBC in the latter part of the term.\n\nHist 336: Imperial and Colonial Archaeology and Museums.\nThis course addresses the history of imperial and colonial archaeology in the nineteenth and twentieth century, and the ways in which archaeological extraction often went hand-in-hand with the European and North American imperial or colonial ventures. We will spend a lot of time discussing the artefacts that arrived in museums as a result of these ventures and what that says about our current \"encyclopedic\" style of museum that purports to share knowledge of the world yet is also a testament to western intervention in Indigenous societies at home and in other parts of the world. Assignments include rewriting an object label from a museum, critiquing a museum exhibition, creating a recorded oral presentation, participating in course discussions, and making a digital exhibition. All reading materials are available via library reserve.",

Wednesday classes will require in-person participation. \n\nHIST 362: The Islamic Golden Age\nThe era of the Abbasid Caliphate is often described as a “Golden Age” of the Islamic World. Throughout the Abbasid Caliphate, communities contributed to global advances in mathematics, science, medicine, literature, theology, art, and philosophy. The famous collection of stories, “One Thousand and One Nights” was compiled during this time and includes the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid as a protagonist. This course explores the political, economic, social, and cultural history of the Abbasids and their contributions to the Islamic World and beyond. We will also investigate how history of the Abbasids lives on in our present day in textual and material archives and in intangible heritage practices. As historians, we will engage historiographic debates, digital methods, public-facing history, and current discussions on heritage and memory to help us analyze the Islamic past and its ongoing relevance to our world today. There are no pre-requisites or expectations of prior knowledge of the Islamic World or the Arabic language for this course.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Instructions for BKIN students: When a course becomes full, registration in the associated waitlist in Workday will become an option. When a seat becomes available, Workday will automatically offer it to a student who meets any restrictions on the seat, ordering students by registration date. Each offer expires after 24 hours. To accept an offer, you must be able to register for a primary or \"lecture\" section for the course and any secondary sections like a \"lab\" or \"tutorial/discussion\"\n\nInstructions for non-BKIN students: Seats in all undergraduate KIN courses are initially restricted to students in the BKIN degree program at the start of the registration period. Non-BKIN students must first register in the associated waitlist section for any course they hope to be considered for a seat in. Please note that being on a waitlist does not guarantee that you will be able to secure a seat. In some cases, KIN Advising may transition available restricted seats to general seats for waitlisted non-BKIN students prior to the start of term but not at the request of any individual student.\n \nAdditional support: Waitlists are adjudicated automatically in Workday, and KIN Advising cannot answer questions about any individual’s position on a particular waitlist.
