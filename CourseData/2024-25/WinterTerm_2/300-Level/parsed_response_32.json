    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "This class focuses on the modern, Western-style spoken theatre in Asia in the 20th century, with plays from China, Japan, India, Indonesia, Korea, and Vietnam. Modern Asian theatre started in late 19th and early 20th centuries as a result of global colonialism, either introduced to colonized countries such as India as part of colonial cultural hegemony or adopted by elite intellectuals in semicolonial nations such as China and Japan to stage nationalism and reform indigenous theatre. We will read and discuss plays and watch videos from early, mid, and late 20th century by playwrights from these nations so as to examine the process in which this foreign theatrical form became part of the Asian theatrical scene, as well as the relationship between modern spoken drama and traditional theatre in these countries.",
