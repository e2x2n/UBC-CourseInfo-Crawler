CENS 307 examines ideas of the witch, witchcraft, and magic from their early historical constructions to recent cultural adaptations. Following these ideas and their relationship to the creation of outsiders, our main topics will be early pagan and Christian religious beliefs; the conflict and overlap of these beliefs in the medieval and early modern periods, including the height of the witch hunts; images of witches in folklore and fairy tales; recent representations of witchcraft in literature, film, and other media; and contemporary witchcraft. The reading and viewing assignments consist of witch-related materials, including historical records; literary, film, and other media representations; scholarly analyses; and other work examining witches, witchcraft, and magic from numerous perspectives. Course blog\n\nAs this lecture section requires registration to the discussion section as well, if the lecture becomes full you can add yourself to the lecture section waitlist and you will be offered a seat for all the required activities if one becomes available. At the moment, the waitlist function for non-graded sections (discussion sections) is unavailable.\n\nInterested in other courses within the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?
