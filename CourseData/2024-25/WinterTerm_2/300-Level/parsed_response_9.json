    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "This course is restricted to students in Year 2 of programs other than the Bachelor of Commerce. It will be offered in a flexible learning format. Rather than attending traditional in-class lectures for three hours each week, students in a flexible format section will spend more time with online learning materials in preparation for fewer scheduled in-person meeting times. Instructors will provide exact dates for in-person meeting times closer to the start of term.\n\nIf you have been admitted by your Faculty to the Minor in Commerce or you are in another approved program for which this course is a requirement, and you are unable to register in any section of this course in your final year of study, you may submit a registration request using the form available at mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/regi-assist. Commerce course registration is managed centrally by the UBC Sauder Undergraduate Office. Change of Registration (Add/Drop) forms signed by instructors will not be accepted.",
