    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Arts of the Northwest Coast Peoples (The South): Re-Examining Underrecognized Visual Cultures of Southern British Columbia, Washington, & the Peripheries \nThis lecture-based course examines ancient and historical Indigenous art forms of the southern Northwest Coast, defined as southern British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and northern California. This region is severely underrepresented in Native Northwest art history, where scholarship tends to emphasize the bold, colorful artwork emanating from northern First Nations including the Haida, Tlingit, and Tsimshian. Redirecting our attention to local settings, we explore the more understated, abstract material culture found in southern locales, with a particular focus on Coast Salish art. In addition, we investigate why different genres of Northwest Coast art exist, and how these diverse styles have been categorized, classified, and even mischaracterized by scholars throughout the decades. Through textual analysis, discussion, research, and public art on campus, we will investigate various mediums: petroglyphs and stone carvings in archaeological contexts; monumental art, architecture, and welcome posts; and belongings such as masks, regalia, and weavings. By the end of the course, you will be able to identify nuances in southern Northwest Coast artistic expression, hypothesize possible reasons for these differences, and possess a greater understanding of Native art traditions in proximity to Vancouver and UBC. \n\n(Note: This course is now offered as part of UBC’s newly required “Ways of Knowing” curriculum, where ARTH 377 is listed as a “Place & Power” class. Place & Power courses offer students new ways to examine local landscapes through the lenses of settler colonialism, decolonialism, Indigeneity, environmental justice, etc.)  ",
