Case studies pair exemplary films and critical texts to explore diverse understandings of place, self, social hierarchies, planetary systems, and models of historical development. Themes include underworlds, homelands, and afterlives; the social production of spaces and natures; concepts of civilization, colonization, and artifice; and conflictual relations between center and periphery, built environments and biomes, sacred and disposable lives.",

Recent scholarship has complicated and refined our understanding of this “genre” and specifically foregrounded its political functions, highly personalized social meanings, and taken up eco-critical perspectives. In this seminar we will work through recent publications to explore the different forms, meanings, and functions of “landscape” during specific historical moments and in different social contexts.",
