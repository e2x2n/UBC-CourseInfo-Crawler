Case studies pair exemplary films and critical texts to explore diverse understandings of place, self, social hierarchies, planetary systems, and models of historical development. Themes include underworlds, homelands, and afterlives; the social production of spaces and natures; concepts of civilization, colonization, and artifice; and conflictual relations between center and periphery, built environments and biomes, sacred and disposable lives.",

Recent scholarship has complicated and refined our understanding of this âgenreâ and specifically foregrounded its political functions, highly personalized social meanings, and taken up eco-critical perspectives. In this seminar we will work through recent publications to explore the different forms, meanings, and functions of âlandscapeâ during specific historical moments and in different social contexts.",
