This poem, De Rerum Natura, is unlike anything else that survives in Latin literature, and yet it has had an enormous influence on Latin poetry, scientific thinking, and the development of modernity.\nDe Rerum Natura teaches its readers a materialist philosophy of the world, which is made up of invisible “seeds” (atoms). But it teaches much more than this, since once we understand that change is the one constant in this material universe, the ramifications are enormous. In the end, Lucretius advises that we not worry so much and just enjoy whatever time we have in this incredible world.\nIn this course, we will read selections from the poem's six books, including Lucretius's explanation of atomic theory; the creation of the world and evolution of humans; why we shouldn't be afraid of death; why love is a mirage; and the spread of a deadly plague. The final selection of passages may be adjusted based on students’ interests.",
