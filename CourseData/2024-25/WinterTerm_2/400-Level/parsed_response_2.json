The course will include a combination of weekly lectures and labs, as well as a major creative project and Beaty Museum Skills Passport. By the end of the course, students will have a foundation in biodiversity science, how biological diversity is preserved in natural history collections, and how those collections are used in scientific research. Along the way, we will explore the historical and contemporary roles of natural history collections in science and society and feature the people behind the collections.\n\nIf you are interested in taking this course and are a non-life science student please email bridgette.clarkston@botany.ubc.ca.",
