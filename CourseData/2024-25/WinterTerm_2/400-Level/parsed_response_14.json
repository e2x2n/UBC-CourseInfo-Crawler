The laboratory section is a placeholder: there is no meeting time and no room assigned. \n\nFRE 490: Spatial Data Analysis and Remote Sensing (Current Issues in Food and Resource Economics)\nThis course introduces students to spatial data analysis and remote sensing using the R programming language with a focus on social science applications. The first half of the course teaches students to create, store, manipulate, and analyze spatial data including points, lines, polygons and rasters. The second half of the course introduces students to color- and texture-based approaches for remote sensing, as well as more advanced spatial data analysis methods. Lectures will teach course concepts, sections will review concepts and teach their implementation, and the lab assignments will give students further experience implementing concepts in code. The course has a midterm exam and final project.\n\nIf you meet the requirements for the course/waitlist but are not able to self-register, please fill out this 2024 Winter Session Registration Request for LFS Courses form.

We will watch and analyze contemporary documentaries on a variety of subjects, representing a spectrum of different approaches to the genre. The heart of the course will be participation in group discussion as we reflect on the tools and techniques filmmakers use, the impacts documentaries have on audiences, and the relationship between non-fiction narrative and real-world social change.",

We’ll consider how Marx’s classic ideas about the commodification and mechanization of culture (Benjamin and Lukàcs), class conflict and social discipline (Simmel and Weber) have been revised and expanded by feminist, queer, post-structuralist, and ecological critics to account for the racialized, gendered, sexualized, and colonial character of capitalist exploitation on multiple scales. CENS 201: Capital and Contexts is recommended, but not required! \n\nInterested in other courses within the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies? Click here.",

Some were ridiculous, some explicitly genocidal; some have disappeared, others are still with us or have recently returned. We will discuss their cultural and historical origins and how they are related to totalitarian visions of control and a radical reconstruction of the world and even life itself. Note: This course is taught in English. As GMST 424 is the permanent replacement for GERM 408, students can receive credit for only one of the two.\n\nInterested in other courses within the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?

Students will explore various approaches to video games, tabletop games, and tarot including game design, game play, and fan cultures to examine how gaming cultures, on the one hand, perpetuate bias, prejudice, and problematic power dynamics and, on the other, are capable of intervening in discourses of oppression, heteronormativity, and settler colonialism. Through the production of mini-games and game prototypes that strive to meet the needs of self-identified social-justice goals, this course will foster students’ ability to critically analyze the societal impacts, representations, narratives, and game mechanics embedded within a variety of gaming cultures.\n\nInterested in other courses within the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?
