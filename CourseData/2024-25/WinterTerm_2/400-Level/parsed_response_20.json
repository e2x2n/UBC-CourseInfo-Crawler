And conversely, how can we, as musicians, contribute to the field of disability studies? In this course, we will work from the perspective that ability and disability are socially constructed rather than biologically determined. Our main goal will be to critically examine how music helps to shape our understanding of disability and ability. By the end of this class, students will have gained a more intimate understanding of how music shapes attitudes towards abilities and bodies, and be able to critique, analyze, write about, and create music with this premise in mind.",

This course will cover the latter half of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Baroque, beginning with the reforms of Martin Luther and the rise of Protestantism (1517ff) and continuing through the period of the Thirty Years War (1618–1648), which brought the age of direct religious conflict to a close. We will be examining the ramifications of Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Catholicism for sacred music of all kinds, including popular as well as cultivated repertories; we will also consider the impact of religious music in colonial missions among indigenous peoples outside of Europe. The music of Palestrina, Lasso, Victoria, Byrd, Monteverdi, Schütz, and others will be considered for its stylistic and cultural significance. A goal of the course is to begin to understand the ways in which music reflected the religious concerns of the era, and served to both highlight and bridge religious differences.",

The courses guiding questions include: what specific cultural practices survived the Middle Passage, and how were they transformed in the New World? Why did these practices develop into sacred traditions such as spirituals, Santeria, Candombl?nd into many secular popular cultures, many of which have evolved into powerful global genres, such as blues, jazz, reggae, rumba, samba, rap and hip hop? In the 20th and 21st century, how have people (including Africans, people of African descent, and marginalized populations without direct historical links to Africa) mobilized certain musics of the African Diaspora as practices of resilience and resistance to slavery, imperialism, and segregation?Students are not required to have a trained musical background.

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "2024W Term 2 Topic:  Neuroscience Foundations of Interventional Brain Medicine \nDescription: \nInterventional Brain Medicine is an emerging subspecialty within the clinical neurosciences (Neurology, Neurosurgery, Psychiatry) that focuses on using advanced neurotechnologies and brain neuromodulation techniques to brain illnesses. The foundation of this approach is the recognition that all brain illnesses emerge from dysfunctional molecular, cellular, and/or system-based mechanisms; therefore, IBM aims to identify dysfunctional brain circuits and then apply specific interventions to correct these dysfunctions.This course introduces the learner to the core brain neuromodulation techniques from the vantage point of their physics, molecular, cellular, and systems-level mechanisms of action. In other words, we learn how these neuromodulation techniques work from the lenses of physics and neuroscience. This course builds on the knowledge gained in NSCI-302 \"Mechanisms of Brain Dysfunction\" but is not a focused on any particular brain illness or aspects of clinical practice of Interventional Brain Medicine.Some of the themes embedded in the course include but are not limited to:- The Brain as a complex dynamical system: embracing Complexity Science as a framework- Biophysics: from energy to biological effects- Brain illnesses as dysfunction of brain networks- Neuroimaging techniques as a window into dysfunctional brain networks (i.e. brain illnesses)- Computational neuroscience clinical applications and translationPrerequisites: NSCI 302",
