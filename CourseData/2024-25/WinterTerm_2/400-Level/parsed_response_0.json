Title: Dead Sea Scrolls. \nThis seminar serves as an introduction to the academic study of one of the most dramatic archeological finds in the last century, the Dead Sea Scrolls. Rediscovered in 1947, the Dead Sea Scrolls continue to change our understanding of the formation of the Bible, religious diversity within Judaism at the turn of the common era, and the origins of Rabbinic Judaism. They also provide insights into the time of Jesus of Nazareth and Early Christianity. This seminar will provide an in-depth study of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the archaeology of Khirbet Qumran to explore how a community understood the role of scripture, law, ritual, festivals, prayer, apocalypticism, and messianism. This seminar will also explore the Dead Sea Scrolls as the site of political, academic, and religious controversies, and as a case study for how technological advances and new methods can challenge early assumptions and result in fresh perspectives. Texts will be read in English translation.\n\nIf the course is full or blocked, or if you do not meet restrictions for the available seats, please register for the waitlist.

In this course, we'll try to separate the myths from the no-less fascinating evidence of life in the prehistoric Greek world. We'll take an in-depth look at the archaeology and art of the societies that arose in mainland Greece, Crete, the Aegean islands and Cyprus, beginning with the transition to agriculture during the Neolithic period but focusing mainly on the period of 3000 to 1100 BCE. We'll examine the material remains left behind by these societies—from monumental palaces and their archives, to the houses, tools and ceramic vessels used in everyday life—in order to understand how Bronze Age people lived and died and to try to explain the development, collapse and resilience of societies in these regions, how they were organized, what their beliefs were, and the interactions they had with neighboring cultures of the Near East and Egypt. We'll also explore how past archaeology, modern politics and pop culture have influenced the interpretation and representation of the Bronze Age past.  The course will approach these topics through lectures, seminar discussions, students research projects and a hands-on lab with ceramics from the Museum of Anthropology.\n\nIf the course is full or blocked, or if you do not meet restrictions for the available seats, please register for the waitlist.
