This course explores these questions by situating medieval art at the intersection of artistic creativity, concerns of patronage, and audience experiences. On the one hand, the course looks at a variety of mediums from manuscript paintings with limited audiences to public sculptures on monumental cathedrals, and on the other hand, it examines medieval art with culturally mixed audiences, and portable objects that crossed cultural, class-based, and gendered boundaries. As such, the course presents medieval art as a lived experience.",
