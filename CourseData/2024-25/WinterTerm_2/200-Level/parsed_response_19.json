THTR 211 emphasizes plays with significant cultural currency and/or impact from 1850 to the present. As comprehensive coverage of drama in this vast period is not possible in this course context, plays have been selected to investigate critical terms and formal innovations specifically related to pioneers of modern drama and socially provocative theatre. The class will consider the particular challenges and opportunities of dramaturgical analysis: what analytical tools, sources of evidence, methodologies and theoretical debates drive the field?\n\nNOTE: You must also register in a corresponding Discussion Section (D11, D12, or D13). If this section if FULL or BLOCKED please sign up for the corresponding wait list section. Once you have registered in the wait list there is no need to contact the department. Your registration will be switched to the parent section when space becomes available. Preference may be given to Majors, Minors, or Honours students in Theatre or Film.
