We will investigate the historical roots of present-day conflicts, such as the fight for political stability on the Balkans, the struggle for Ukrainian lands, and the latent state of war in the Caucasus. Classes will be dedicated to lectures on and discussion of films and literary texts that reflect on these issues.\n\nMore course information here\n\nCheck out more courses from the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies Click here",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Gender & Sexuality in Central, Eastern, and Northern European Literature and Culture \nIn this course, we will explore how discourses on gender and sexuality shaped and were shaped by 19th- and early-20th-century literature and culture. We will read select short prose, drama, and novels from central, eastern, and northern Europe. We will consider how these works relate to emergent sexological writings, women’s rights debates, emergent modern subjectivities (e.g., new woman, queer), and political movements. Throughout the course, we will also consider the relevance of these literary traditions for our current moment. To this end, each student will present on a contemporary news item that connects to issues of gender and sexuality in the contemporary moment. Students will then turn this presentation and the class discussion it generates into a 500-word Blog Post. The class will thus build a public record of your interrogation of issues of gender and nation as it connects to modern issues via the publication of a special issue of the German Program’s Undergraduate Online Journal Augenblick \n\nInterested in learning about other courses offered in the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?

In addition to reading fiction and poetry, we will explore works by Bauhaus artists and architects and watch Weimar-era Kammerspielfilme (“chamber dramas”).
