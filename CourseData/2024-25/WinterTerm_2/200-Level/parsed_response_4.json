    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Gender & Sexuality in Central, Eastern, and Northern European Literature and Culture \nIn this course, we will explore how discourses on gender and sexuality shaped and were shaped by 19th- and early-20th-century literature and culture. We will read select short prose, drama, and novels from central, eastern, and northern Europe. We will consider how these works relate to emergent sexological writings, women’s rights debates, emergent modern subjectivities (e.g., new woman, queer), and political movements. Throughout the course, we will also consider the relevance of these literary traditions for our current moment. To this end, each student will present on a contemporary news item that connects to issues of gender and sexuality in the contemporary moment. Students will then turn this presentation and the class discussion it generates into a 500-word Blog Post. The class will thus build a public record of your interrogation of issues of gender and nation as it connects to modern issues via the publication of a special issue of the German Program’s Undergraduate Online Journal Augenblick \n\nInterested in learning about other courses offered in the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?
