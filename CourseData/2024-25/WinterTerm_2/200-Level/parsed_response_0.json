    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Archaeology of Ancient China This course invites you to embark on an enthralling exploration of ancient China, from its earliest beginnings to the emergence of its first civilizations through quintessential archaeological excavations and recent ground-breaking discoveries, spanning from the primal Peking Man to the awe-inspiring Terra-Cotta Warriors, from the invention of pottery to ceremonial drinking rituals, and from the timeless beauty of jades to the intriguing world of ancient bronzes. This course seeks to illuminate how archaeology has profoundly rewritten historical narratives and transformed our understanding of the making of Chinese culture and society.\n\n Upon completing this course, students will be expected to learn and understand the essence of major archaeological discoveries and their importance in shaping and transforming our perception of ancient China. Furthermore, the course aims to foster an understanding of the modern-day relevance of these discoveries within the contexts of both contemporary China and the global stage. The course will help students develop analytical skills for assessing and interpreting archaeological data. It further aspires to learn how to appraise a myriad of research themes and inquiries, facilitated by the detailed examination of compelling case studies in the investigation of early China.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "The goal of this course is to familiarize students with contemporary approaches to the analysis of communication in diverse cultural contexts. The course is ethnographically oriented in that students will consider descriptions of communication from around the world. These case studies include studies focusing on the cultural characteristics of communication, cross-cultural communication, gendered features of communication, and communication through media. Within each of these themes we will consider theoretical issues relating to the social functions of communication, cultural identity, ethnicity, power, and ideology. \n\nLectures and discussions will focus on the methods used in studies of culture and communication and the contributions of this research. We will also view video clips relating to weekly topics. The readings for this course often point to ways that communication reflects social and cultural complexity. The weekly topics address diverse aspects of communication, but they are united in addressing the many ways that social and cultural processes are carried out through communication.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Instructor: Dr. Camila Cavalli. Animal Cognition is a 3-credit course. Students of this course will get an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of Comparative Cognition. Traditionally, Comparative Psychology has been regarded as the comparison of the behaviour of different species, usually considering human behaviour as the standard to what non-human species are compared. Drawing from the fields of Animal Behaviour, Philosophy and Psychology, we will compare species in diverse areas such as their particularities to perceive the environment, how physical cognition affects their problem-solving abilities and tool use, as well as their differences in social cognition, prosocial behaviour and communication. Through all this, we will question the notion of humans being the sole parameter of comparison, and promote a critical view that allows us to embrace each species uniqueness. This understanding of animal cognition will be helpful to take on more advanced courses in related fields, as well as it has important applications for assuring animal welfare.",
