It examines fundamental concepts, methodologies, and thematic explorations shaping this field of study. From language to politics, from rituals to virtual spaces, cultural anthropologists analyze the intricacies of societies worldwide. Through lectures, discussions, and immersive activities, we will explore the notion of 'culture' and the method of participant-observation. Engaging with ethnographic accounts, we will investigate the familiar and the unfamiliar, learning to challenge perspectives, question norms, and cultivate critical thinking.",
