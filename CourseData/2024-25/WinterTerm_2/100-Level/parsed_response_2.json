    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Archaeology is a field of anthropology that studies past societies, their practices, and behaviors as inferred through the analysis of their material and biological remains. This course explores how archaeologists develop knowledge of the past, and how this knowledge is continuously questioned and improved upon. Archaeologists do not provide “final answers”; our understandings change as the kinds of questions we ask and the methods we use change. However, while there may be no “right” answer, there are better and worse ones — ones with more or less supporting evidence. Students will become familiar with the field of archaeology and with all phases of the research process.",
