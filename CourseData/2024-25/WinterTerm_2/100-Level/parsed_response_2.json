This course explores how archaeologists develop knowledge of the past, and how this knowledge is continuously questioned and improved upon. Archaeologists do not provide “final answers”; our understandings change as the kinds of questions we ask and the methods we use change. However, while there may be no “right” answer, there are better and worse ones — ones with more or less supporting evidence. Students will become familiar with the field of archaeology and with all phases of the research process.",
