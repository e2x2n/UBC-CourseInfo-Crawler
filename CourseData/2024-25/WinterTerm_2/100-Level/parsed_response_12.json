Beyond exploring the 'big' players and issues, we will undertake three more significant tasks. First, we will examine local contexts to investigate the GWOT's impact on diverse communities and individuals, seeing how they have experienced, contributed to and/or resisted the GWOT. Second, we will examine how the GWOT has helped create a politics of fear that permeates our world and inculcate suspicion of certain racialized communities. Finally, we will grapple with how diverse actors have confronted and/or resisted this politics of fear.",
