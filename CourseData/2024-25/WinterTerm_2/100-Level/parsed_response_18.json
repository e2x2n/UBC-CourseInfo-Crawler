All students taking PHYS 108 are advised to also register for PHYS 119 (1 credit lab course) as well as the PHYS 129 (1 credit enriched lab).  *Please note PHYS 107 is now replaced by PHYS 106. Students intending to pursue any of the Physics and Astronomy specializations require the PHYS 119 lab. For those student pursuing Life Sciences, the PHYS 129 enriched lab is a recommended extra lab credit.\nFor more information please refer to our First Year Physics Guide: https://phas.ubc.ca/undergrad-first-year-guide for 1st year PHYS course options. Please contact ug-phys1@phas.ubc.ca  for any questions regarding PHYS 106 or PHYS 108 registration, PHYS 119 or PHYS 129 labs, or tutorials. If you require assistance with registration, please contact the Physics Undergrad Program Coordinator at ugcoord@phas.ubc.ca. (If the SSC does not recognize your completion of pre-requisites for this course, or if you are currently enrolled in the pre-req, please contact ugcoord@phas.ubc.ca in advance, to assist in registration.
