    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "The Department of Central, Eastern, and Northern European Studies is thrilled to introduce Yiddish language courses for UBC students—in a flexible, multi-access format. Our 3-credit courses will cover the foundations of the language and connect students to Yiddish music, film, and literature. Says Faith Jones, of the Vancouver School of Yiddish Translators: “When somebody speaks to me in Yiddish, I really feel it as an act of great care and great love.” Come join the new community of UBC students learning, loving, and finding joy and meaning together in Yiddish, a thousand-year old European Jewish language with a bright future!\n\nInterested in other courses within the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?
