Designed as a small group class with individual coachings, it comprises discussion and exploration of the multiple skills engaged when playing piano music at first sight. The class is a supportive and non-competitive environment, blending experiential discoveries of tools and means, reflections on cognitive obstacles, and confidence-building discussions. The weekly sessions build new understanding of piano sight-reading by examining its components separately and combining them with new awareness of its multi-layered process.No pre-req, can be taken in any year.General Studies Piano Concentrators - please submit a registration request for support with registration: https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cIvdTe2ov1zJ1Ns",

In this course we scour the strange and unsettling world of Nordic fiction through themes like death, anxiety and folklore to find the key to true Nordic happiness.\n\nSample syllabus here.\n\nInterested in other courses within the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?
