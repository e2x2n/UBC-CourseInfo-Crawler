This course examines the historical and contemporary practices and critical debates of intercultural performance. Topics include: pre- and early-20th century European encounters with Asian theatre, intercultural theatre productions and debates of the 1980s and 1990s, Asian Shakespeare productions, and contemporary intercultural performance in North America. We will approach these issues through a combination of lectures, discussions, video production viewings, reaction papers, and group projects. ",
