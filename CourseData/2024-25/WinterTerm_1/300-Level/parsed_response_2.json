For over 1,000 years it has been read and re-read, illustrated and adapted, by artists and scholars, the nobility, samurai, and commoners. \nOver the course of the term students will read the text in its entirety translated in the language of their choice (English, Modern Japanese, Chinese, French, etc.). We will be paying particular attention to illustrations and visual adaptations of the Tale, from 12th century illustrated scrolls to contemporary manga and anime. The Tale of Genji has influenced virtually every aspect of Japanese culture and students will be encouraged to devise research projects that satisfy their individual interests, whether that be, for example, food or erotica. \nDelivery Mode -This is an in-person course.

Starting from the colonial period until the contemporary, each week will explore a milestone moment in Korea’s modern history and examine the relationship between history and culture. At times, we will study how culture of the time engaged with contemporaneous issues. At other times, we will examine how historical issues are remembered and reemployed in subsequent cultural works. Per week, there will be one film and two readings: one historical overview and one article analysing the film. In examining this link between history and film, students will gain a thorough knowledge of the key historical happenings that have shaped modern Korea, paying special attention to formations of gender, class, and national identities, as well as a deep understanding of the ways in which culture reflects/challenges/distorts history.\n\nDelivery Mode -This is an in-person course.
