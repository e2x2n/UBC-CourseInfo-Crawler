For over 1,000 years it has been read and re-read, illustrated and adapted, by artists and scholars, the nobility, samurai, and commoners. \nOver the course of the term students will read the text in its entirety translated in the language of their choice (English, Modern Japanese, Chinese, French, etc.). We will be paying particular attention to illustrations and visual adaptations of the Tale, from 12th century illustrated scrolls to contemporary manga and anime. The Tale of Genji has influenced virtually every aspect of Japanese culture and students will be encouraged to devise research projects that satisfy their individual interests, whether that be, for example, food or erotica. \nDelivery Mode -This is an in-person course.

Per week, there will be one film and two readings: one historical overview and one article analysing the film. In examining this link between history and film, students will gain a thorough knowledge of the key historical happenings that have shaped modern Korea, paying special attention to formations of gender, class, and national identities, as well as a deep understanding of the ways in which culture reflects/challenges/distorts history.\n\nDelivery Mode -This is an in-person course.

These are then submitted online, through the Course Website. There are no lectures to attend or video lectures to follow. The only time students need to attend a session in-person is for the written final exam. The final exam will be written during the UBC exam period, at a time and date arranged by UBC Exam Services. All students will attend the final exam in-person in a UBC classroom.",
