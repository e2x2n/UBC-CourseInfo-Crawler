Requests that do not follow these guidelines may be denied without consideration.\n\nIf your request is approved, we will either grant you permission to register yourself (if your registration date has not yet arrived), register you for a lecture and tutorial section (if it has and a seat is available), or otherwise: waitlist you with an effective waitlist date no later than the next business day after the date your request for registration assistance included complete information.",
