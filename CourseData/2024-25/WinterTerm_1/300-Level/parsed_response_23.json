In this course, we will explore the theme of “nineteenth-century news” and periodical literature against the larger background of the political and social developments of the period. We will study a selection of short texts and visual materials related to the German-speaking periodical press in Europe (1800-1900) while learning strategies that will improve your reading, writing and conversational skills in German.\n\nNote: All GERN-coded courses are conducted in German-plus (i.e., German, plus any additional multilingual experiences students bring to the course).

Siegfried the dragon slayer came to epitomize the mythical age of heroes; the poetry of Walther von der Vogelweide foreshadowed modern notions of love; and the legends of Hartmann von Aue explored a courtly society coming to terms with the triumph of Christianity.In this course, we will study key literary traditions of the German Middle Ages. The first section is dedicated to the heroic epic and, above all, the paradigmatic example of the Nibelungenlied. Subsequently, we will discuss the court culture of the High Middle Ages, focusing on the courtly novel and the Minnesang tradition. In the final weeks of the term, our attention will turn towards texts that reflect on medieval religious culture, and we will conclude our seminar with an outlook on the Reformation period.\n\nSample syllabus here.\n\nInterested in other courses within the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Cross-listed with GMST 341. The German Middle Ages produced some of the most prolific images, motifs and narratives in the Western canon. Siegfried the dragon slayer came to epitomize the mythical age of heroes; the poetry of Walther von der Vogelweide foreshadowed modern notions of love; and the legends of Hartmann von Aue explored a courtly society coming to terms with the triumph of Christianity.In this course, we will study key literary traditions of the German Middle Ages. The first section is dedicated to the heroic epic and, above all, the paradigmatic example of the Nibelungenlied. Subsequently, we will discuss the court culture of the High Middle Ages, focusing on the courtly novel and the Minnesang tradition. In the final weeks of the term, our attention will turn towards texts that reflect on medieval religious culture, and we will conclude our seminar with an outlook on the Reformation period.\n\nSample syllabus here.\n\nInterested in other courses within the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?
