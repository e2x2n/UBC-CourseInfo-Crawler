In this course, we will speak to various actors, musicians, artists, writers and other creatives about the ways their emotional and physical geographies - and in particular, their relationship to national identity - influence what they create. This 3-hour course will involve experimental writing in-class; conversations with creatives and course assignments that go beyond the traditional academic essay.

They were a distinct part of the Nazis extermination efforts, and the cause of tremendous suffering for the Jewish population of the occupied territories. Focusing on memoirs and literary texts, students will examine the various facets of these extreme spaces; giving insight into their development, the Nazi policies surrounding them, the social, cultural and economic order that emerged inside of them, the organization and experiences of everyday life, resistance, and finally the deportations and liquidations.\n \nInterested in other courses within the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?

Auschwitz is a site of conflicted memories that are built on memoirs, literary texts, documents and movies. Focusing on stories of survivors, students will learn and discuss how the Holocaust is remembered and commemorated.\n\nInterested in other courses within the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?

Students analyze various texts spanning historical and contemporary contexts, exploring themes such as identity, memory, nationalism, migration, gender, and urban life. By the course's conclusion, students will develop a nuanced understanding of the political, cultural, and social dimensions of European comics. They will refine their critical thinking and visual analysis skills within broader socio-historical frameworks by connecting their assessment of the comics as an art form and cultural artifact to other disciplinary perspectives in German studies, literary studies, cultural studies, art history, and museum studies. In addition to the work of visual analysis, this course will encourage students to use the drawn image critically by producing visual notes and making comics themselves. In particular, the final project asks students to create comics based on archival material, investigating how creators utilize historical documents to craft narratives.\n\nInterested in other courses within the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?\nClick here",
