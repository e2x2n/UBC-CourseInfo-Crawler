The geo-cultural areas to be studied include Africa (Ghana. Mali, Zimbabwe), The Americas (Native North, Central and South America), Europe, and Asia (India and Indonesia). Musical genres include, but are not limited to, folk, court, ritual, popular, art/classical, and narrative traditions from selected music cultures of the above geo-cultural areas. The course intends to develop an understanding for a variety of music in the world through lectures, lecture demonstration and discussion, audio-visual presentations, workshops, and if possible, live performances.This course is open to all students, and may be taken for credit toward the B.Mus. and the B.A. in Music.",
