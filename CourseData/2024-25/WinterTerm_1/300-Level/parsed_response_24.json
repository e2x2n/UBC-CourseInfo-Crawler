    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "HIST 321A RESTRICTED TO 3RD YEAR HISTORY HONOURS STUDENTS\nLocal Acts on a Global Stage: Research Seminar on UN Habitat ‘76 in Vancouver\nIn 1976 the United Nations convened the Habitat conference on human settlements in the emergent and much-admired global city of Vancouver. Delegates from over 150 countries convened to discuss the challenges and possibilities of modern cities, and to draft a set of principles for global urban development. Writing of Habitat a year later, the Canadian planner Humphrey Carver claimed that “what was done in Vancouver may well prove to be a turning point in history - although we cannot yet know if this will prove to be so.”  Was it a turning point? If so, for whom and how? If not, why not? What was the legacy of Habitat for its participants, for Vancouver, and for global diplomacy and urban development? In this intensive research seminar, we’ll conceive, research, and write a history of Habitat ‘76. We’ll identify and explore relevant archival collections at UBC and the City of Vancouver. Each student will focus on a different aspect/impact of Habitat and prepare a chapter for a book of collected essays.",

Significantly, however, the course is guided by two crucial interrelated objectives: First, we will examine the idea of the modern Middle East, grappling with complexities and nuances obscured by the dichotomization of ‘modern’ and ‘traditional’ and exposing the tensions produced by ‘modernity.’ Second, students will interrogate popular historical and contemporary representations of the region and its populations. We will seek to understand the impact of these representations in spurring conflict, colonial endeavors, resistance, and false dichotomies between ‘us’ and ‘them.’ On this last note, and in a very personal way, we will all critically reflect on our own past and present visions of the Middle East and our role in perpetuating certain images and stereotypes of the region, its histories and peoples.",

When a seat becomes available, Workday will automatically offer it to a student who meets any restrictions on the seat, ordering students by registration date. Each offer expires after 24 hours. To accept an offer, you must be able to register for a primary or \"lecture\" section for the course and any secondary sections like a \"lab\" or \"tutorial/discussion\"\n\nInstructions for non-BKIN students: Seats in all undergraduate KIN courses are initially restricted to students in the BKIN degree program at the start of the registration period. Non-BKIN students must first register in the associated waitlist section for any course they hope to be considered for a seat in. Please note that being on a waitlist does not guarantee that you will be able to secure a seat. In some cases, KIN Advising may transition available restricted seats to general seats for waitlisted non-BKIN students prior to the start of term but not at the request of any individual student.\n \nAdditional support: Waitlists are adjudicated automatically in Workday, and KIN Advising cannot answer questions about any individual’s position on a particular waitlist.
