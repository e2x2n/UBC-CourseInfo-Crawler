    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Instagram. Blogs. TED Talks. YouTube. Podcasts. These and many other new media genres are increasingly transforming the way research is received and circulated beyond academic institutions and used by public audiences. In a fast-changing communication landscape, it is necessary to understand the rhetorical purposes of these genres, the stylistic features and strategies that make their circulation of research (in)effective, and how, through new media genres, public audiences are using, reframing, and even subverting knowledge produced in the academy. In this course, students will analyze, critically assess, and produce these forms of media themselves.\n\nSee course description here: WRDS Undergraduate Course Descriptions - School of Journalism, Writing, and Media (ubc.ca)\n\nThis course can be used towards the Minor in Writing and Communication: Minor in Writing and Communication - School of Journalism, Writing, and Media (ubc.ca).",
