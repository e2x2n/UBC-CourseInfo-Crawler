    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "If Workday indicates that you do not meet the CPSC 320 prerequisites, but you have taken CPSC 221 and one of the courses credit-excluded with STAT 200 in the UBC Science Credit Exclusion List, then you may submit a Request for Registration Assistance Form as described at:\nhttps://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses-deadlines/cpsc-appeals-steps-undergraduate-students.\n\nPlease ensure that you include in your message exactly what course that you have taken is credit-excluded with STAT 200 and which section(s) of CPSC 320 (lecture and tutorial) you are interested in, in priority order. Requests that do not follow these guidelines may be denied without consideration.\n\nIf your request is approved, we will either grant you permission to register yourself (if your registration date has not yet arrived), register you for a lecture and tutorial section (if it has and a seat is available), or otherwise: waitlist you with an effective waitlist date no later than the next business day after the date your request for registration assistance included complete information.",
