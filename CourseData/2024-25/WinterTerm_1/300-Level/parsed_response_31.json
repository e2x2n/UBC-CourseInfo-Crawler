    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Course Description: The European Enlightenment of the long eighteenth century (1790 to 1815) was inspired by the achievements of the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century. Philosophers believed that a comparable progress could be attained for the moral and political sciences, and thereby expand liberty and freedom. The Enlightenment also marked the advent of secular thought and was, for the most part, strongly anti-clerical. This course will examine this important philosophical era with a critical eye, first reading three major contributions to moral and political philosophy, short works by John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Mary Wollstonecraft, and then covering three major contributions to epistemology and metaphysics, short works by George Berkeley, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant. This course will provide a solid foundation for your study of modern philosophy.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Course Syllabus - click here\nThis course has two themes: computability and logic. In the first part of the course (chapters 1-8 of our text), we characterize what it means (classically) for a function to be computable. We develop three different definitions of computability, using Turing machines, abacus machines and recursive functions. This part of the course concludes by demonstrating that all three definitions are equivalent: any function that counts as computable on one of the definitions also counts as computable on the other two as well. This equivalence result provides some support for Church’s Thesis (which states that all effectively computable functions are recursive functions).\nThe second part of the course (chapters 9-14) develops some of the main ideas of intermediate logic. For this part, we assume that you have a solid grasp of predicate logic. That is, you should understand truth-functional connectives and quantifiers; you should be able to symbolize English sentences in a formal language; and you should know how to construct proofs in first-order predicate logic. Rather than doing proofs within a system of predicate logic, our principal aim in this course is to prove important facts about our system of predicate logic itself.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Course Syllabus - click here\nThere are two well-developed philosophical theories that try to characterize what it means to make choices rationally. One is decision theory, which considers the position of one agent choosing between several alternatives, with varying levels of information about factors that might influence the resulting outcomes. The other is game theory, which provides techniques for analyzing interactions among several rational agents.\nThis course explains the fundamentals of these two theories and relevant background concepts such as probability and utility. We also explore paradoxical situations where the theories appear to clash with ordinary intuitions about rationality. We will consider applications throughout the course, with emphasis on social applications of game theory, and conclude with an introduction to evolutionary game theory and a discussion of Skyrms’ book, Evolution of the Social Contract.",

Those debates all begin with John Rawls’ A Theory of Justice. Rawls defends an account of what justice is in general and the two principles that a society must satisfy in order to be just. He also broaches the project of institutional design—that is, the design of legal, economic, social, and political institutions capable of satisfying the two principles of justice. The second half of the course surveys a number of critical responses and alternatives to Rawls selected from the following theories: libertarian, Marxist, communitarian, republican, feminist, and critical race. ",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Course Description: This course provides an introduction to contemporary metaphysics within the analytic tradition. Metaphysicians attempt to make sense of reality in its most general aspects and to resolve seeming paradoxes that immediately arise once we start to reflect on these general aspects of reality. In this course, we will ask such questions as: What kinds of entities exist? For example, does reality contain abstract entities like numbers and properties or is reality exhausted by concrete particulars like physical particles variously arranged? And under what conditions (if any) does a collection of microphysical entities (e.g., particles) compose a macroscopic entity, such as a table or an organism? Is the world causally structured, and what does it even mean to say that one event ‘causes’ another to happen? When something undergoes a change (e.g., in size, shape, or location), what makes it the same object to the one it was before the change occurred rather than a totally new object? Might our subjective impression of time’s ‘passage’ be an illusion and might be possible, in principle, to travel backward or forward in time? Can we reconcile the appearance of free will with the possibility that the laws of nature are ‘deterministic’ or might the experience of free will be – possibly like the experience of the passage of time – be illusory? Are certain classifications of objects and other phenomena objectively more natural than others, serving to ‘carve nature at its joints,’ or are all ways of classifying the world irremediably subjective and human-centric? Are some phenomena be “socially constructed” and, if so, which ones?",

This course explores the early foundational texts whose visions will shape Indian philosophical instincts, inquiries, and debates moving into the classical period of systematic thought. With a focus on primary texts in translation, we’ll begin with the early Vedas and the Brahmanical Epics (the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata) and then move to explore reorientations and challenges to the early Vedic worldview in the Upaniṣads and by the Buddha.

These are first-order judgments, about how things ought to be or which actions are right or wrong. But we can also ask “meta” questions about the nature of ethical judgment itself. For instance, we can ask: What do we mean when we say that killing innocent people is wrong?  When two people disagree about an ethical question, must one person be wrong? Is the truth of ethical judgment relative to culture, individual perspective, or some other parameter? We can also ask questions about the nature of ethical properties and facts, like: Are there objective moral facts “out there” in the world to-be-discovered, just as there are objective facts about (say) electrons? And we can inquire about ethical knowledge: If there are ethical facts, how do we know about them? Questions such as these form the basis of metaethics and will be the focus of this course.",
