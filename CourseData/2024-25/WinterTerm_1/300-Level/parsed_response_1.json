    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "This course tracks the major themes and practices in artistic production in early twentieth-century Europe and North America known collectively as “Modernism,” from the bold expressionism of the turn of the century to the stark minimalism of the 1960s. Situating visual and material cultural within the historical contexts of the two World Wars, the boom of consumer capitalism, and new forms of colonial expansion, our course will interrogate the definitions and limits of “modernism” and “modernity” within the history of art.",

How do particular photographic practices shape our assumptions about reality, fiction, history, or memory? How do they perpetuate power dynamics or produce new forms of relationship and being-with-others? How are they naturalized or activated by storytelling?",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "“We live in a world of images,” says the Brethren of Purity, a group of Muslim philosophers from ninth-century Baghdad. This course takes its cue from there and explores the fascinating world of making, viewing, and experiencing images in the lands of Islam: from frescoes to portable objects, and from manuscript paintings to photography. We will see that unlike prevalent prejudices and assumptions, images were an integral part of life for people from all echelons of society across the Islamic world, and in remarkably diverse ways. Hence, the course challenges the misconception that Islamic Art was anti-image. Learn more on the ARTH 350 blog: https://blogs.ubc.ca/arth350/",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "This course traces the history of Early Modern through Postmodern art as the history of paradigm shifts in the technological mediation of the phenomenal world. We explore single- point perspective, often understood to be the crowning achievement of Western illusionistic pictorial construction, as it developed in dialogic relationship to mathematics, geometry and architecture. We then move through the heliocentric revolution that undergirds the Early Modern period and the new technologies of social organization that found the institutions of the 18th and 19th centuries, informing the Enlightenment era’s development of aesthetics. Finally, we explore the discourse of and relationship between medium and media that informs visual cognition and mediates social relations in the 20th century.",
