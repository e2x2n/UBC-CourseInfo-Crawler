What does it mean to live in a world where images of dragons protected buildings? And what happens when a sultan issues a fatwa to combat vampires? This course explores monsters, and the art of the occult in the Islamic World, by situating them in the broader context of “Monster Studies.” Inspired by the works of Donna Haraway and Jeffrey Cohen, the course appreciates the monster as the ultimate expression of difference and challenges all binaries, whether pertaining to art history, or to societal norms.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "ARTH 476\nSeminar in North American Indigenous Art: Art vs. Artifact and the Role of Historical Indigenous Material Culture \nHistorical Indigenous material culture occupies a fraught position within the art world. Native masks, tools, regalia, ceramics, and weavings are often categorized in contemporary society as “art,” although these items possess important socio-economic, religious, cultural, political, and gendered meanings, as well. Utilizing MOA’s collections and using case studies from across Canada and the United States, this course examines Native art beyond the realm of aesthetics or visuality and instead considers the original cultural significance and intended purpose of historical objects. Lectures, discussions, and fieldtrips explore Indigenous-made objects of the pre- and early colonial periods, with students learning how to conduct original research on objects, archives, and collections. Readings, presentations, and assignments address timely questions related to Indigenous art of the past and present, including: What obstacles arise when art is disconnected from its cultural context?, What are the consequences of displaying historical Indigenous items in galleries and museums?, and, What role did collectors, curators, and artists play in transforming everyday objects into highly desirable artistic masterpieces? \n\n(Note: This course is discussion and participation based, with grades relying heavily upon attending class/fieldtrips and presenting your work in front of peers.) ",
