The laboratory section is a placeholder: there is no meeting time and no room assigned. \n\nImpact Evaluation Analytics: This course is designed to introduce students to the principles and applications of project monitoring & evaluation (M&E). The world of international development faces many challenges, one of which is the failure of assistance interventions (aid projects and programmes). Students will develop a practical understanding of the logical processes by which projects are designed and implemented, including the need for external evaluation in order to assess the efficacy, outcomes, and sustainability of these interventions. Lack of project success, more often than not, is a result of inadequate impact evaluation strategies. Students will learn skills to develop strong monitoring & evaluation plans in order to overcome these deficiencies.\n\nIf you meet the requirements for the course/waitlist but are not able to self-register, please fill out this 2024 Winter Session Registration Request for LFS Courses form. An LFS Academic Advisor will assess your eligibility for registration and you will be notified accordingly.",
