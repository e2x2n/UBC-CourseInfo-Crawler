    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Gender and Nation in European Literatures \n\nCross-listed with GMST 517A. This course is focused on concepts of “nation-building” in central, eastern and northern Europe in relation to discourses of personal and political Emancipation, Enlightenment, as well as Orientalism. It falls into four modules: (1) Concepts of “Nation” in Canada and Europe, focusing on narrative prose between Canadian First Nations as well as German ad Russian perspectives. (2) Emancipation, Revolution and “Nation”, focusing on political poetry of the 1848-revolution in central Europe. (3) Enlightenment, Race, Religion and “Nation” focusing on 18th century plays about crusades, colonialism, slavery and gender (4) Gender Politics and “Nation” around 1900, focusing on plays with military definitions of ‘nation-states’ and the role of officers’ daughters. \n\nThis course has no prerequisites. Language of instruction is English. All course materials will be provided on Canvas. It is offered in a once-a-week workshop format, and both at the undergraduate (CENS 404) and graduate levels (GMST 517A). This class is taught in mixed-mode of in-person and online meetings and assignments. Remote participation via Zoom is possible. Please inquire with instructor.\n\nInterested in other courses within the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies? Click here.",
