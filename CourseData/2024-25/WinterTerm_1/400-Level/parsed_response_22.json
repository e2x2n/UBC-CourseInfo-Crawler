The course is organized around various musical elements such as timbre, rhythm, form, melody, and instrumentation. We will analyze each of these topics by juxtaposing a variety of traditional and popular case studies from eastern, western, central, and southern Africa. Comparing and contrasting these indigenous styles of musicking will allow us to understand both the unifying, pan-African components and unique, localized characteristics of each cultural practice. This will promote a broad understanding of how African music (loosely defined) is conceptualized, composed, and performed. To complement the general overview our survey provides, we will deepen our understanding of the aforementioned musical elements with a unit dedicated to the musical cultures of Zambia. Coursework includes a balance of lecturing, engagement with audiovisual material, and hands-on music making. The course does not require the purchase of any textbook; all materials will be provided by the instructor or made available in the library. It is open to all students and does not require any previous training in music or familiarity with the African continent. This course is designed to both stand on its own and complement the Music of the African Diaspora course.\n\nAlthough MUSC 328 is listed as a pre-requisite, students may take MUSC 428 without a pre-requisite.
