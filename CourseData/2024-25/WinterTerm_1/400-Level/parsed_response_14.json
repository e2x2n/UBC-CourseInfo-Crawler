Restricted to students registered in the final year of the BFA Acting Program and/or the BFA Film Production Program. \n\nCourse Description\nThis course takes an ensemble of BFA Acting students and Film Production students through the process of creating an original feature film developed through a collaborative process of improvisation, group writing, and location shooting.   The project culminates in a two-night screening of the film at an on-campus venue TBA (Frederic Wood Theatre or The Nest).\n\nCourse Details\nAs the NAKED CINEMA project is an integrated component of the Department of Theatre and Film's production season, it's schedule is unlike that of a more conventional course.  However, this allows for some flexibility for students with conflicting schedules in that not all students need to be in class all the time.\n ",
