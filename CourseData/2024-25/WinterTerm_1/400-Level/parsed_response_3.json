Priority will be given to 4th-year Biology students on the waitlist who need a 2nd lab course to graduate if any seats become available in the lab courses after the 3rd-year Biology students have registered. Biology students can only complete or be registered in two biology laboratory courses or waitlists.  Non-biology students interested in taking these courses are to register themselves on the waitlist. They will be considered after all biology students are successfully registered for the course from the waitlist.   \n\nStudents may only register for one required course activity per lecture/lab/discussion or waitlist if there is no space available. Students will be removed from the waitlist if they already have a spot in a section of the course.  For example, students may not register for multiple labs or discussions, including their respective waitlists.  BEING ON THE WAITLIST DOES NOT GUARANTEE YOU A SPACE IN THE LECTURE, LAB, OR DISCUSSION. ",

In order to test a theory, one must understand it, at least well enough to generate reasonable hypotheses, predictions, and experiments that meet critical assumptions. However, many theories in ecology are represented using math, which can create a barrier for scientists with less mathematical training, as is commonly the case in many biology programs. This course is meant to introduce students to theoretical ecology using an accessible approach.",
