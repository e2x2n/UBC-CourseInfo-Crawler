    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Seminar in Biblical Studies. Title: Disability and Biblical Literature. \nInstructor: Isaac Soon\n\nThis course analyzes the portrayal of disability and disabled figures in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. The study of disability is a recent advancement in the study of ancient history, especially biblical studies. Students will become familiar with cutting-edge theoretical discussions in the field of disability studies concerning “healing” (or body modification), bodily agency, health, ableism, and normality as they relate to biblical texts. Do these biblical texts portray healing as essential? Is disability an individual or social issue? Do “healthy” lives experience greater quality of living? Do biblical texts hope for a future where disability is eliminated and erased? Are key figures in biblical texts (e.g. Abraham and Sarah, Moses, Jesus, Paul) able-bodied? Focus will be given to representations (vs. realities) of disability, the lived experience of disability in the ancient world, and the recovery of disabled histories. Students will gain skills and knowledge that can be applied to the study of disability in their own respective fields and industries. This course offers students the unique opportunity to challenge contemporary conceptions of disability in the medical sciences, humanities, and popular culture by engaging critically with disability in the past.\n\nIf the course is full or blocked, or if you do not meet restrictions for the available seats, please register for the waitlist.

The purpose and context of these works within the imperial policy of each emperor will also be considered. While the course will concentrate on monuments in the city of Rome, we will also discuss some examples from outside the capital.

By studying the works of influential scholars across major anthropological traditions, we discuss the discipline's “conditions of existence.” Through contextualizing key theorists and their texts, we explore the central questions driving anthropological inquiry and study the evolution of concepts and theories. Through critical analysis, we navigate the interplay between theoretical frameworks, social contexts, and ongoing scholarly dialogue. This course therefore helps us explore our discipline's intellectual heritage.",

We will critically consider early approaches to classification in the Arctic and subarctic in regard to language, material culture, and social organization, and we will consider how these categories are mirrored in many contemporary Indigenous classifications emerging to define parameters of identity.  We will discuss anthropological models of realities (ontologies), belief systems, cultural ecology, political economy, ritual practice, concepts of ethnicity, and gender systems in terms of how they intersect with contemporary local concerns about power, systems of knowledge and personhood, gender systems, and national identity.  ",

Studying how parent material, climate and land use affect soil-plant interactions and resulting soil profile development is central for understanding the rationale behind soil classification and for applying the basic concepts of land use and management that optimize resiliency and sustainability in terrestrial ecosystems. Knowledge of pedology, soil genesis and soil classification are fundamental to the management of land resources, from both practical and policy perspectives. For students interested in gaining more depth in understanding basic concepts in pedology, soil genesis and applying soil classification principles, APBI 490F is a foundational course. This course will combine in-class (lectures on soil genesis and soil taxonomy principles, together with flipped classroom approaches) and in-field learnings (3-night field school last week of August).\n\nIf you meet the requirements for the course/waitlist but are not able to self-register, please fill out this 2024 Winter Session Registration Request for LFS Courses form.
