We will read texts that will hopefully help us understand how the Romans wrote about different forms of grief and loss, as well as how they consoled each other – or, indeed, themselves. In addition to reading extensively in Latin we will also explore the language and expression of loss in a range of other ancient and modern authors in English or in translation into English in order to develop our own nuanced understanding of how we express our sorrows and attempt to console others, and how this language may or may not be suitable to apply to the Romans and to translate Latin texts. \nIn Latin we will read selections from the following authors: Catullus; Cicero; Horace; Ovid; Seneca the Younger; Statius; Virgil; and some inscriptional material.  (The syllabus can be adjusted to read other authors, if students have a wish to read something in particular on this theme.) \nIn English we will read short selections from: Cassandra Austen (the sister of Jane Austen); Boethius; Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill/Eileen O’Connell; John Donne; Lucian; C.S. Lewis; Milton, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; Pablo Neruda; Plutarch; Sophocles; Suetonius; Dylan Thomas, and W.B. Yeats, as well as any other author students might wish to read.",
