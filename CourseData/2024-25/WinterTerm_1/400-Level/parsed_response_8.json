By end-of-day Tuesday Sep 17, 2024, students must complete a scheduling survey with the course staff. Any who are unable to schedule their oral examination time will be denied permission to take the course and have their registration removed.\n\nWithin the Monday 1-4PM period, we do expect flexibility to accommodate students’ scheduling constraints as long as they have at least one contiguous 30-minute slot available. Most oral examinations will be conducted in groups. It is student responsibility to join a group with a compatible schedule. The oral examinations are a central element of this course, and no accommodation can be made.\n\nPermission of the department to register is automatically granted if you meet the prerequisite listed above. Please do not request permission.\n\nIt is possible to receive credit for up to two CPSC 436 offerings that are different courses, i.e., those with different letters after the 436 number. Students may not receive credit for the same CPSC 436 offering more than once. Similarly, if a CPSC 436 offering later transitions to a regular course number, students may not receive credit for that offering and the subsequent course. Students wishing to receive credit for more than two CPSC 436 offerings must appeal for permission.",
