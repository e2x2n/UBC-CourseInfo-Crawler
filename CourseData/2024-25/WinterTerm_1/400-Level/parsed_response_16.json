    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Agriculture and Environment: For the past ten thousand years, agriculture has been the primary driver in both the rise and fall of human civilizations. Today, agriculture remains the foundation of nearly all human societies, shaping in very fundamental ways both our environment and our economic, political, and cultural systems. In the past half century we have experienced very sudden and sweeping changes to the way we practice agriculture, due primarily to rapid advances in key areas of science and technology. Unfortunately, while our agricultural system is rapidly evolving, our understanding of how these changes are affecting both society and the environment struggles to keep up. This course examines the contemporary dynamics of global agriculture and food production systems in order to build a more robust understanding of the social, economic, and environmental benefits and problems associated with our current global food regime. Topics to be explored in this course will be determined by the students, and could include local and global agro-food systems, political ecology of food, global commodity chains, green & blue revolutions, cultural patterns of consumption, agricultural bio-technologies, agribusiness, food security, agriculture related social movements, bio-fuels, and of course the environmental impacts of agriculture. Seminars will combine group work and discussion with short lectures and videos. Students will be expected to voice opinions and engage in &~ critical and informed debate on the course material. Course texts will be supplemented with weekly readings. This course also draws upon a range of video and other media to explore the interactions between agriculture and the environment.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "This interdisciplinary upper-level undergraduate seminar examines global and public health issues as influenced by climate change and im/mobilities, and vice versa. The ongoing climate crisis affects every facet of planetary life, and human and non-human population im/mobilities are major responses to some of the negative effects brought on by climate change. Climate change, migration and health are interdependent processes, and human health cannot be understood outside of planetary health. This course therefore examines the intersections of all three, and how they shape everyday lived experiences. Please note that this course is cross-listed for both grads and undergrads, but assessment modes and expectations will differ for the respective levels.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Special Topics Title: Decolonizing Disability: Towards the Abolition of Carceral Spaces with Dr. Jasbir Puar\n\nDescription: \nThis advanced undergraduate seminar brings together several literatures to explore connections between disability justice, prison abolition movements, and anti-imperialist transnational organizing. The imperative to understand the relationships between carceral spaces, debility, and disability is greater than ever in the face of the rise of authoritarian governments under the guise of democracy; engulfing forms of disaster capitalism and climate change; the swelling of refugee, migrant, and abandoned populations; unprecedented levels of mass incarceration, policing, and counter terrorism surveillance; the consolidation of post-1971 speculative financial markets and the sustaining of US empire through privatized debt and deficit economies; repression of political protest, freedom of speech, and the right to assembly; the failure of human rights to stem state violence; and finally, the blooming of local, regional, transnational and global modes of abolitionist decolonial resistance, refusal, and revolt. These contemporary forces create disability and debility while concomitantly impacting disabled people disproportionately.  \n\nAbolitionist Angela Davis writes that “the abolition movement…cannot simply occur in one country.” Following Davis’ lead, examining the global circuits of infrastructures of incarceration such as prisons, detention centers, migrant and refugee camps requires a transnational approach. “Decarcerating Disability” is a frame developed by disability studies scholar Liat Ben-Moshe to situate histories of institutional incarceration of disability as well to understand the debilitating effects of incarceration. Drawing from Ben-Moshe’s work on “carceral spaces,” we will expand this direction of inquiry beyond prisons to include analyses of the space-time containments of carceral capitalism, logistics as warfare, and infrastructures of containment such as occupation, blockades, militarized zones, checkpoints, border walls, and the non-lethal weapons industry.\n\nIn turn we will look at the abolitionist decolonial ideologies, organizing, and forms of resistance to these interconnected technologies of immiseration that are envisioning and demanding futures free of carceral enclosure. The Abolition and Disability Justice Coalition, Deadly Exchange, Sins Invalid, and #StopCarceralAbleism are just some examples of anti-imperialist disability justice movement organizations which are challenging the global networks that incarcerate disabled people, produce mass debilitation, and create impairment.\n\nWe will be reading work from abolition studies, critical disability studies, southern disability studies, and critical race studies. The readings for the class have been selected because along with attention to subjectivity, subject formation, and identity they develop analytics for systems and structures that span international scales--legal apparatuses, maiming as global governance, debt as spatial enclosure, the biopolitics of settler colonialism, racial capitalism, the commodification of violence--that critically form and impact relations of gender, sexuality, race, class, disability, and nationhood.  ",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Special Topics Title: Gender, Race and Social Justice in Emotions and Everyday Life with Dr. Alifa Bandali\n\nDescription: Emotions and affect have injected ‘the feeling body’ into academic discourse, from intersectional studies, critical race theory to gender studies. In particular, knowledge production that takes seriously affect and emotions challenge what has become a part of dominant ways of knowing that is recognizable through terms such as ‘neutral’ and ‘objective’ that remove experience and politics from the conversation and dialogue. This course is interested and takes seriously the role of emotions; the nexus between everyday life and emotions; the importance of knowledge production and emotions to examine: “What do emotions do?”\n\nAs the Feminist Killjoy Sara Ahmed states: “The ‘doing’ of emotions…to consider the relation between emotions and (in)justice, as a way of rethinking what it is that emotions do.” (2014, 191) This course begins with the premise of what emotions do and builds on this sentiment to explore what can we do with them. We will trace affect and emotions not solely from academic trajectories, but its uses in women of colour and marginalized experiences through writings, activism, scholarship and politics. We will consider emotions such as anger, happiness and empathy (to name a few), along with themes related to the nation-state, popular culture and the media, institutional places and spaces and more.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "In 2024W, HIST403E The Middle East in Graphic Novels: History, Politics, and the Tragic Comic\nOnce thought of as juvenile and immaterial to politics, society and culture, graphic novels are today frequently considered art forms, political satires and/or intellectual compositions fundamental to the health of our polities as well as our imaginings of past and present. This course will explore graphic novels with a focus on their representation of Middle Eastern history, politics and peoples. Reading such works as Joe Sacco’s Footnotes in Gaza, Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis, Craig Thompson’s Habibi, and others, we will discuss the evolution of the medium, the fraught history of visually representing the Middle East, as well as the challenges and opportunities graphic novels present for understanding the region. On this latter note, particular attention will be paid to the contentious use of graphic novels as works of journalism, oral history, and autobiography as well as to fundamental questions on the ethics of graphically representing tragic episodes from Middle Eastern pasts. Finally, given recent events associated with cartooning (i.e. the Charlie Hebdo massacre) we will also seek to grapple with such divisive issues as Islamophobia, Orientalism, free speech, and the uses and limits of satire.",

Delegates from over 150 countries convened to discuss the challenges and possibilities of modern cities, and to draft a set of principles for global urban development. Writing of Habitat a year later, the Canadian planner Humphrey Carver claimed that “what was done in Vancouver may well prove to be a turning point in history - although we cannot yet know if this will prove to be so.”  Was it a turning point? If so, for whom and how? If not, why not? What was the legacy of Habitat for its participants, for Vancouver, and for global diplomacy and urban development? In this intensive research seminar, we’ll conceive, research, and write a history of Habitat ‘76. We’ll identify and explore relevant archival collections at UBC and the City of Vancouver. Each student will focus on a different aspect/impact of Habitat and prepare a chapter for a book of collected essays.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "In 2024W, History 490T, Print Culture and International Relations: Europe, 1870-1907, is a research seminar designed to introduce students to the torrent of popular European print media focusing on key events in international relations between 1870 and 1907. Working with primary sources including regular and illustrated newspapers, political cartoons, images, postcards and song sheets, we will consider the role of mass media in politicizing popular culture in relation to significant events such as the unification of Germany, the first Hague Peace Conference, the Boxer Uprising, and more. While examining the context and significance of the various media, we will consider questions related to their production, commodification and consumption, as well as the interpretation of their messages and meanings. Throughout the seminar, our frames of inquiry will employ the historiographical lenses of nationalism, international relations, the public sphere, print and visual culture, and the history of emotions.",
