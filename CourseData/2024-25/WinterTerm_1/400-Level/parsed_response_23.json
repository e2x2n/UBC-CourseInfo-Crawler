    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Topic: Sound WritingApproaching the study of sound and poetry this course will introduce students to a range of writing, sound art, and listening practices. We will question how we transcribe/translate our multi-sensory experiences of sound through different forms of writing and will spend time listening together to recordings, readings, and to the land and waterways of this place. We will ask what listening does as we collectively create scenarios and event scores for de-centering listening habits. In addition to listening to recordings we will also listen to each other read, activating our voices, and exploring various interpolations of written form. Through listening prompts, we will practice recognizing/naming/distilling what we hear, thinking of how we might respond to what we hear, and forming creative written and oral/recorded responses that may include poetry, lyric, fiction, auto-theory, performance, and more. The course's procedural work will lend itself to a final project that will include both a written and oral (or audible) component.Restricted to 4th year undergraduate students and graduate students. Registration by permission of instructor.

Anscombe, Philippa Foot, Iris Murdoch, and Mary Midgley--have been credited with changing the direction of moral philosophy in the middle of the 20th century, as two recent popular philosophical books argue.  Each of them is an important figure in her own right, but collectively, their work, friendship, and approach to philosophy marked a significant shift in ethical thought, including a revival of interest in Aristotle's ethics and \"virtue ethics.\"  This course will look at the philosophical world they were trained in, how they objected and responded to it, and what lasting impacts their work has had. It will also serve as an introduction to some of their most important works as well as the history of mid-20th century analytic philosophy. ",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Course Description: This course provides an advanced introduction to contemporary work on the ‘mind-body problem.’ This is the problem of understanding the metaphysical relationship between the mental and the physical. Our discussion will be organized around the thesis of ‘physicalism’: the thesis that, in a sense to be made precise, everything is physical. We will begin by asking how best to formulate the thesis of physicalism, focusing on what the physicalist means by ‘everything’ and what they mean by ‘physical.’ Having done so, we will turn to the topic of mental causation. According to many physicalists, the reality of mental causation provides a powerful source of support for their position. Our goal will be to understand why they have thought this and assess whether they are right. After considering debates about mental causation, we’ll turn to questions about mental content, i.e., the ‘aboutness’ of mental states. We will consider some influential physicalist attempts to explain mental content as well as the principal challenges that have dogged physicalist accounts of mental content. From content, we turn finally to consciousness. Here, we’ll consider the arguments that contemporary ‘dualists’ have offered for believing that the existence of consciousness is inconsistent with physicalism, as well as the main ways physicalists have attempted to rebut these dualist arguments. In the time that we have left, we’ll examine some historically neglected views of the mind-body relationship that have been receiving increased attention recently. We'll discuss: ‘mysterianism’ (the view that the relation between consciousness and the physical lies forever beyond the cognitive grasp of humans); ‘illusionism’ (the view that consciousness is illusory); ‘panpsychism’ (the view that mind or consciousness is somehow woven into the physical fabric of the cosmos); and even some varieties of ‘idealism’ (the view that everything, including the physical cosmos, is a mental construction).",
