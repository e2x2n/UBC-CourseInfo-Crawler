There is no textbook for this course. All Quizzes and Assignments are open over a set number of days for students to complete when it fits best within their own schedule. These are then submitted online, through the Course Website. There are no lectures to attend or video lectures to follow. The only time students need to attend a session in-person is for the written final exam. The final exam will be written during the UBC exam period, at a time and date arranged by UBC Exam Services. All students will attend the final exam in-person in a UBC classroom.",
