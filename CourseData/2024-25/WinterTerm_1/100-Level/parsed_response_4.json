    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "This course investigates Canadian monuments to communities that immigrated from Central and Eastern Europe to Canada. Some of these monuments speak to memories that are integral to Canadian identity, such as the National Holocaust Memorial. Others, such as the Memorial to the Victims of Communism, represent interventions in controversial debates. We will examine the cultures of remembrance surrounding these public artworks from a variety of perspectives, including memory studies, art history, urban planning, cultural studies, postcolonial studies, and decolonization. At the same time, we will review the history that brought the settler communities from Austria, Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Ukraine, and Russia to Canada. Our focus will lie on communities and memorials that have featured prominently in public debates about Canadian identity over the past two decades.\n\nCheck out more information  here\n\nInterested in other courses from the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?
