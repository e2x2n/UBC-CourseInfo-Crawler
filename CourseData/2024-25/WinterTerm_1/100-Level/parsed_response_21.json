    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "This section of PHIL 102 will only involve full class meetings (no discussion section meetings). To register, students must also register for PHIL102.L06, but this “discussion section” will not involve additional scheduled meetings.\n\nPlease note: PHIL 101 and PHIL 102 are independent introductory courses and do not need to be taken in sequential order.\n\nOverview\nIn a sense, this course is not so much about moral philosophy as about your lives. Through introducing a number of value and moral theories, this course aims to develop your ability to identify ethically/morally relevant considerations, consider the interests of relevant stakeholders, make ethically/morally-informed decisions, and, ideally, find creative solutions to resolve ethical/moral problems. You will also have opportunities to use your own lived experience to critique moral philosophy.\nMoreover, this course aims to prepare you for upper-year philosophy courses by developing your reading, writing, and thinking skills. \nLearning Objectives\nAt the end of the course, successful students will be able to:\n(1) identify and analyse ethical and moral problems,\n(2) make ethical and moral judgements based on relevant, reliable information, realistic understanding of the situation in question, and sound reasoning\n(3) find creative solutions to resolve ethical and moral problems\n(4) present, object to, and defend ethical and moral judgements and solutions.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Course Description: This course is an introduction to critical thinking with a primary focus on the principles of argumentation. We will ask: what makes an argument good or bad, reasonable or unreasonable? How should one go about evaluating an argument? Philosophers have developed a handy toolkit for handling such questions, which this course will familiarize you with. The philosopher’s toolkit includes a taxonomy of standard valid and invalid argument forms, as well as some common mistakes that people make when making arguments. It also includes skills for dealing with the ‘informal’ aspects of arguments, beyond what is strictly contained in their formal structure. This includes tools for evaluating an argument’s inductive strength and plausibility of an argument’s premises, and for distinguishing an argument’s logical strength from its rhetorical force. Here, questions about the content of our concepts, and their context of use, become particularly relevant. As we’ll see, in the messy world of informal reasoning no strategy is infallible. However, you will learn a variety of techniques which will be useful across your academic, professional, and personal lives.",
