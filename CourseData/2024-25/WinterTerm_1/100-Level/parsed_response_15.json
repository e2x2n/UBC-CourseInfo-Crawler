When a seat becomes available, Workday will automatically offer it to a student who meets any restrictions on the seat, ordering students by registration date. Each offer expires after 24 hours. To accept an offer, you must be able to register for a primary or \"lecture\" section for the course and any secondary sections like a \"lab\" or \"tutorial/discussion\"\n\nInstructions for non-BKIN students: Seats in all undergraduate KIN courses are initially restricted to students in the BKIN degree program at the start of the registration period. Non-BKIN students must first register in the associated waitlist section for any course they hope to be considered for a seat in. Please note that being on a waitlist does not guarantee that you will be able to secure a seat. In some cases, KIN Advising may transition available restricted seats to general seats for waitlisted non-BKIN students prior to the start of term but not at the request of any individual student.\n\nAdditional support: Waitlists are adjudicated automatically in Workday, and KIN Advising cannot answer questions about any individual’s position on a particular waitlist. Please do not contact instructors to assist with course registration, as they do not have access to register students. Students can find tutorials on how to navigate registration in KIN courses here: https://kin.educ.ubc.ca/undergraduate/how-to-workday. Additional resources on navigating Workday Student, please visit: https://workday.students.ubc.ca/",
