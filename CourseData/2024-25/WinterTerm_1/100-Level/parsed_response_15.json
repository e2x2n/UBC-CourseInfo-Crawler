    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Instructions for BKIN students: When a course becomes full, registration in the associated waitlist in Workday will become an option. When a seat becomes available, Workday will automatically offer it to a student who meets any restrictions on the seat, ordering students by registration date. Each offer expires after 24 hours. To accept an offer, you must be able to register for a primary or \"lecture\" section for the course and any secondary sections like a \"lab\" or \"tutorial/discussion\"\n\nInstructions for non-BKIN students: Seats in all undergraduate KIN courses are initially restricted to students in the BKIN degree program at the start of the registration period. Non-BKIN students must first register in the associated waitlist section for any course they hope to be considered for a seat in. Please note that being on a waitlist does not guarantee that you will be able to secure a seat. In some cases, KIN Advising may transition available restricted seats to general seats for waitlisted non-BKIN students prior to the start of term but not at the request of any individual student.\n\nAdditional support: Waitlists are adjudicated automatically in Workday, and KIN Advising cannot answer questions about any individual’s position on a particular waitlist. Please do not contact instructors to assist with course registration, as they do not have access to register students.
