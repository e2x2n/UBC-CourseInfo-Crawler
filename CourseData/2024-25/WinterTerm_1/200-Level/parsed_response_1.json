The course emphasizes movement and transcultural connections as key dimensions of art. Students will be evaluated based on a combination of individual and group output.",

This includes the spread of Buddhist art along the Silk Roads, artistic exchanges in the Mongol Empire, contacts between early modern courts, artistic responses to colonialism and, and Asia in the global contemporary art world. Focusing on these connections allows the examination of selected works across time and space as embedded in changing social, religious, political, and economic frameworks.",

By looking extensively at contemporary artist’s practices and the historical works and moments that inspired them, participants in this course gain a broad understanding of the history of North America and how this impacts us today. From this, we see how contemporary Indigenous artists honour the work of their ancestors through their practices today.",
