But the line between fact and fiction is not always clear — our understandings of the past are constantly changing, and alternative perspectives can challenge research in productive ways. Over the semester, students will acquire the tools to discern between valid controversies and no-so-valid claims through the critical exploration of archaeological hoaxes, myths, and propaganda, and will assess how archaeology is portrayed in fiction and media. Throughout these exercises, students will identify the responsibilities that archaeologists hold towards the public as storytellers of the past.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "This course is about “the supernatural,” and why are we fascinated with it. Why are some things considered “supernatural” in Western cultures, and what does that even mean? Where do supernatural beliefs come from? How do people experience and explain supernatural phenomena? How are witches, vampires, zombies, and other supernatural creatures enjoying a new life in the modern world? These are some of the questions this course will address.\n \n“The supernatural” is a category of beliefs, phenomena and experiences that didn’t fit with the scientific paradigm developed in the West as a result of Enlightenment notions separating the rational from the irrational.  Most non-Western cultures do not separate these phenomena and experiences from the natural world in quite the same way. Despite predictions that supernatural belief would vanish as populations became more educated, supernatural practices and beliefs are still very much alive in both Western and non-Western contexts.  This course explores why and how that happened.  As part of a process of decolonizing knowledge, we will also examine supernatural and occult traditions as they appear in the context of religion, narrative, healing, ritual and media accounts and representations in Western cultures.  Our methods will be informed by how anthropologists and folklorists (scholars who study traditional, expressive culture) have approached these topics.\n \nOur primary focus in this course is not belief, but practice: what people do and why they do it.  **This course does not attempt to prove or disprove the existence of supernatural phenomena.**  Rather, it takes an ethnographic, phenomenological approach to this issue, focusing on people’s lived experience and their attempts to make sense of it.  You will be encouraged to explore the relationship between scientific belief and supernatural belief in the context of both traditional cultures and the contemporary social and cultural landscape.\n \nNote that while we will learn about witches, vampires, and zombies, **they will not be the only topics covered in this course**.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "In this course, we will centre Indigenous sovereignty as action, Indigenous world-making as relational stewardship and care, and Indigenous teachings as holistic interconnections to nonhuman beings, Ancestors, the Supernatural, and place. Focusing upon Indigenous resistance and resurgence in the face of over 200 years of British colonialism and Canadian assimilation policies of land dispossession, resource extraction, and defining and controlling Indigenous bodies in what is now known as British Columbia, we will recognize the work of Indigenous knowledge holders, artists, leaders, and nations to reclaim, embody, and rematriate rights through language and ancestral governance revitalization. As a settler scholar, curator at the Museum of Anthropology, and cultural anthropologist who works collaboratively with First Nations on the Northwest Coast, we will reflect on the power of self-representation through Indigenous art, media, and (in)tangible heritage with the aim of Indigenous community well-being and healthy futures.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "\"Insects as Food and Feed\" is a 3-credit course. The course aims to provide an understanding of the benefits and limitations of entomophagy from the perspective of health, environment and livelihood. The course will discuss the challenges encountered to develop insects as a new protein source for food and feed. The course will include insect rearing methods, preparation and processing of insects and incorporating them as an ingredient in food and feed products. Aspects of entomophagy are explored through student reviews of recent research articles and presentations to the class. Some in-person and online components, but students are expected to engage w/ the class at the posted times. Please see course syllabus and Canvas for details.",

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "Instructor: Dr. Camila Cavalli. Animal Cognition is a 3-credit course. Students of this course will get an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of Comparative Cognition. Traditionally, Comparative Psychology has been regarded as the comparison of the behaviour of different species, usually considering human behaviour as the standard to what non-human species are compared. Drawing from the fields of Animal Behaviour, Philosophy and Psychology, we will compare species in diverse areas such as their particularities to perceive the environment, how physical cognition affects their problem-solving abilities and tool use, as well as their differences in social cognition, prosocial behaviour and communication. Through all this, we will question the notion of humans being the sole parame&&~ ~ ter of comparison, and promote a critical view that allows us to embrace each species uniqueness. This understanding of animal cognition will be helpful to take on more advanced courses in related fields, as well as it has important applications for assuring animal welfare.",
