    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "THTR 210 Drama: Forms and Ideas I\n\nTHTR 210 is an introduction to the study of dramatic literature, with a particular focus on western theatrical traditions from the fifth century BCE to the eighteenth century CE. The course contextualizes the plays read in their original cultural and socio-political context, while teaching students how to read these plays as texts which encode performance. We will examine original performance conventions tied to each play that we study, but we will also consider how these plays have been reperformed in later periods. The classes consist of two large-scale lectures on Mondays and Wednesdays and a smaller discussion-based class each Friday. This is an introductory course and students are not expected to have a background in theatre, either in reading dramatic literature or in thinking about plays in performance.\n\nNOTE: You must also register in a corresponding Discussion Section (D11, D12, D13). If this section is FULL or BLOCKED please sign up for the corresponding wait list section. Once you have registered in the wait list there is no need to contact the department. Your registration will be switched to the parent section when space becomes available. Preference may be given to Majors, Minors, or Honours students in Theatre or Film.
