It examines religions as complex systems that share certain fundamental common features. The primary focus in this course is not theology, but practice: what people do and why they do it. Additionally, the class examines how spirituality fits into the broader context of everyday human life. While we will examine a wide variety of religions, this course is not designed to study each religion in depth. In a time of religious dynamism and conflict, this course is designed to make you aware of others’ worldviews and religious systems, to encourage critical thought about religious belief and practice, and to promote confidence in learning from religious diversity.",
