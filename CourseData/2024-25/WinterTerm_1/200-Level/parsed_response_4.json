    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "CENS 201: Capital and Commentary, Part I -- Contexts\nMarx’s Capital (Das Kapital) is arguably the best known book in the canon of European Studies, and yet also the least read! The challenge, or wager, of this course is to read Capital as a literary, philosophical, sociological, historical, political and economic experiment in thinking otherwise about our past, present, and future. Together we’ll explore how Marx’s passion for both interpreting and changing the modern world speaks to his own context as well as to ours, with a focus on his ideas about class exploitation, settler colonialism, the gendered division of labour, chattel slavery, economic crises, and ecological breakdown. Knowledge of languages other than English, including but not limited to German, is an asset but not a prerequisite!\n\nInterested in checking out other courses from the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?

    "Course Section Definition Public Notes": "This course on Great Works of Literature from Central, Eastern and Northern Europe is taught in English and discusses European identities from a decentred point of view. Its goal is to question where Europe begins, ends, and where its centre could be located, culturally and geographically. We critically review hierarchies of power in a short story by Franz Kafka, the colonial context of European history by reading a fairy tale by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, discuss how Germany dealt with the Holocaust after 1945 (Bernhard Schlink: The Reader), and look at Europe from the East by focusing on post-communist Europe and the ‘Balkan’ region (Slavenka Drakulić: Café Europa Revisited). We will also study journalistic writings and documentaries that deal with the EU extension in 2004.\n \nThis course is designed to strengthen critical thinking by comparing texts and film adaptations from different countries and periods. All course material is in English. There are no prerequisites. Major texts are available as ebooks. Additional sources will be available on UBC Canvas. The course is taught fully online: All assignments for the asynchronous parts and all Zoom lecture notes (ppt) of the synchronous online lessons on Tuesdays will be posted on Canvas.\n\nMore information here.\n\nInterested in learning more about other courses in the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies?

It opens with mythologies of creation and catastrophe and discourses of eco-criticism in feminist and indigenous perspectives. The course readings fall into four modules, treating a wide range of narrative prose works that deal with seismic upheavals, plague epidemics, apocalyptic and dystopian visions, ecological, technological and social disaster, nuclear accidents and warfare.
