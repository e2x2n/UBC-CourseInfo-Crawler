Philosophy students may register in either PHIL or AMNE.\nCourse Description: This course traces the early evolution of ancient Greek philosophy, the “love of wisdom” (philosophia), from its roots in Homeric oral poetry (c. 800 BCE) to the Socratic dialogues of Plato (429-347 BCE). We’ll focus on the ancient Greek search for knowledge about nature and the human condition, which many philosophers attributed to an injunction from the Oracle at Delphi: “Know Thyself.” That inquiry unfolded into mythological and scientific speculation about reality and cosmology, human freedom and well-being, and new conceptions of statecraft and justice in cities like Sparta and Athens. \nWe’ll trace these themes through Presocratic thinkers like Pythagoras, Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, and explore the insights of women like Aristoclea of Delphi, Diotima of Mantinea, and Perictione of Athens, respectively depicted in Greek literature as teachers of Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato. According to later sources, their traditions argued for ethical non-violence, sustainable communities, gender equality in education and government, and a theory of stable metaphysical patterns underlying visible reality. These threads converge in Plato’s depiction of Socratic self-cultivation (epimeleia tou heautou), combining novel instruments of rational inquiry with personal inspiration to seek human flourishing (eudaimonia) as a goal of each individual and community.",

(with software), CSLI Publications.\n\nHard copies should be available at the Campus Bookstore.

The material starts easy during the first 2-3 weeks but quickly gets more challenging after that. If you are not regularly keeping up with the course material covered, it will become very difficult for you to catch up later. This is so especially because mastering the later material will require you to know the earlier material well.\n\nFORMAT:\nThe textbook comes with a software that you will use to study the material and do/submit the assigned homework.   Please register your software to Grade Grinder (read the Introduction of the book for instructions).  The textbook site also allows registered students to watch videos containing lectures by the two authors of the textbook.  You can access these lectures through the \"Online Course Material\" side tab on the LPL site.   Attending the classes are not mandatory, but highly advised.",
