In some cases, KIN Advising may transition available restricted seats to general seats for waitlisted non-BKIN students prior to the start of term but not at the request of any individual student.\n\nAdditional support: Waitlists are adjudicated automatically in Workday, and KIN Advising cannot answer questions about any individual’s position on a particular waitlist. Please do not contact instructors to assist with course registration, as they do not have access to register students. Students can find tutorials on how to navigate registration in KIN courses here: https://kin.educ.ubc.ca/undergraduate/how-to-workday. Additional resources on navigating Workday Student, please visit: https://workday.students.ubc.ca/",
